# VDOgate Supabase Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Supabase for the VDOgate pre-launch website and make the founding creator form fully functional for production.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account (free tier works perfectly)
- Basic knowledge of environment variables

## Step 1: Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up/log in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: VDOgate Pre-launch
   - **Database Password**: Create a strong password (save this!)
   - **Region**: Choose the closest region to India (e.g., Singapore or Mumbai if available)
4. Click "Create new project" and wait for it to initialize (~2 minutes)

## Step 2: Set Up the Database Schema

1. In your Supabase project dashboard, go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql` from this project
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
6. You should see "Success. No rows returned" - this means your database is set up!

## Step 3: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. In your Supabase project, go to **Settings** â†’ **API** (left sidebar)
2. You'll see two important values:
   - **Project URL**: Something like `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`
   - **anon public key**: A long string starting with `eyJ...`
3. Copy these values - you'll need them next

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. In your project root, create a file called `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Open `.env.local` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   ```

3. Replace `your_project_url_here` with your Project URL
4. Replace `your_anon_key_here` with your anon public key

## Step 5: Test the Integration Locally

1. Restart your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
3. Navigate to the "Founding Creator" section
4. Fill out and submit the form
5. Check your Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to **Table Editor** â†’ **founding_creators**
   - You should see your test submission!

## Step 6: Verify Database Setup

Check that your database is properly configured:

### Check Tables
- Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase
- You should see: `founding_creators` table

### Check Policies (Security)
- Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Policies**
- You should see:
  - âœ… Allow anonymous inserts (for form submissions)
  - âœ… Allow authenticated reads (for admin access)

### Check the Data Structure
Your `founding_creators` table should have these columns:
- `id` (uuid, primary key)
- `full_name` (text)
- `email` (text, unique)
- `phone` (text)
- `location` (text)
- `profession` (text)
- `instagram_handle` (text, nullable)
- `youtube_channel` (text, nullable)
- `portfolio_url` (text, nullable)
- `why_vdogate` (text)
- `current_challenges` (text)
- `monthly_income_goal` (text)
- `agreed_to_terms` (boolean)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (timestamp)

## Step 7: Deploy to Production

### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
3. Click "New Project" and import your repository
4. Add environment variables:
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` with your URL
   - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your key
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Your site will be live in ~2 minutes!

### Option B: Other Platforms

Make sure to set the same environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Viewing Submissions (Admin Access)

### Method 1: Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Click **Table Editor** â†’ **founding_creators**
3. View all submissions with full details
4. Export as CSV if needed

### Method 2: API Endpoint
You can also access submissions programmatically:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/founding-creator
```

This returns JSON data with all founding creator applications.

## Database Statistics

The schema includes a `founding_creators_stats` view that shows:
- Total creators registered
- Unique professions
- Unique locations
- Daily signups

To query it:
```sql
SELECT * FROM founding_creators_stats;
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing Supabase environment variables" Error
- âœ… Check that `.env.local` exists in your project root
- âœ… Check that variables start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- âœ… Restart your dev server after adding environment variables

### Form Submission Fails
- âœ… Check browser console for error messages
- âœ… Verify your Supabase credentials are correct
- âœ… Check that RLS policies are enabled
- âœ… Ensure the database schema was run successfully

### "Email already registered" Error
- This is expected behavior - the form prevents duplicate emails
- Check the Supabase table to see if the email exists
- Use a different email for testing

### Database Connection Issues
- âœ… Check that your Supabase project is not paused (free tier pauses after 7 days of inactivity)
- âœ… Verify the Project URL is correct (no trailing slash)
- âœ… Check that the anon key is the "anon public" key, not the service role key

## Security Notes

âœ… **Row Level Security (RLS)** is enabled
âœ… Anonymous users can only INSERT (submit forms)
âœ… Only authenticated users can read data
âœ… Email validation prevents duplicates
âœ… Phone validation ensures valid Indian mobile numbers
âœ… All data is encrypted at rest in Supabase

## Production Checklist

Before going live, ensure:

- [ ] Environment variables are set in your hosting platform
- [ ] `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (already done)
- [ ] Database schema is deployed to Supabase
- [ ] RLS policies are enabled
- [ ] Test form submission works on production URL
- [ ] Verify email uniqueness constraint works
- [ ] Check that data appears in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Set up email notifications (optional, see below)

## Optional: Email Notifications

To receive email notifications when someone submits the form:

1. Go to **Database** â†’ **Webhooks** in Supabase
2. Create a new webhook for the `founding_creators` table
3. Set up a service like Zapier or n8n to send emails
4. Or use Supabase Edge Functions to trigger emails

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs: **Logs** â†’ **Database**
3. Review the API route: `app/api/founding-creator/route.ts`
4. Check the form component: `components/FoundingCreator.tsx`

## Database Backup

Supabase automatically backs up your database daily. To manually export:
1. Go to **Database** â†’ **Backups**
2. Click "Export" to download your data
